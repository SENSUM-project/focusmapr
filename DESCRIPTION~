Description: the package implements the concept of Focus Map, a raster description of the spatial importance indicator of a set of combined layers. The Focus Map can be interpreted as a spatial distribution of data sampling probability given the input layers and the weights of their combination. The Focus Map is generated by a "mapping" and a "pooling" operations. The package has been implemented in the framework of SENSUM FP7-SPACE Project.
