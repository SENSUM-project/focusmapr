Title: computation of Focus Maps from a set of input raster or vector layers

Description: the package implements the concept of Focus Map, a raster description of the combined spatial importance of a set of input layers. The Focus Map can be interpreted as a spatial distribution of data sampling probability given the input layers and the weights of their combination. The Focus Map is generated by a "normalization" (or "mapping") and a "pooling" operation. The package has been implemented in the framework of the FP7-SPACE Project SENSUM (Grant agreement no: 312972).
